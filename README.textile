h1. LockFileRemover

During debugging Netbeans Platform applications I have very often get an error message from Netbeans that alread an application is running. That's often enoug not true, but Netbeans just forgot to remove the
build/testuserdir/lock file after debugging, and so I had to delete it manually.

So I wrote this plugin which adds an action to the toolbar and context menu to remove that file easier then going via the file system.

I'm happy if that tool is useful for you, too.
